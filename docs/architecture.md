# Architecture notes

Reference notes for writing your own Chapter 3 (Methodology) and Chapter 4
(Results) — not dissertation prose. Use these as a technical map; write the
narrative yourself in your own words with your own actual numbers.

This file reflects the pipeline as it actually ran for the full
349-policy experiments. See `docs/limitations.md` for issues found
during development and what remains unresolved.

## Structural chunking: built, not included in the reported comparison

`src/chunking/structural_chunker.py` implements heading-aware section
splitting (using the `## <heading>` markers `html_cleaner.py` inserts).
It is fully functional and was piloted early in development, but is
**not** one of the three configs in the reported 349-policy comparison
(`experiments/configs/` only defines `fixed_300`, `fixed_500`, and
`semantic`).

This was a scope decision, not an oversight: the project's core
research questions (RQ2, RQ3) specifically compare fixed-size vs
semantic-boundary chunking, and adding a third structural variant
midway through the experimental runs would have meant either
re-running all three existing configs with a fourth added, or reporting
an unbalanced comparison. `structural_chunker.py` is retained in the
codebase as a documented candidate for **future work** — a natural next
step would be a four-way comparison (fixed / structural / semantic /
hybrid) once time allows, since heading-aware splitting could plausibly
combine some of semantic chunking's context-coherence with lower
compute cost (no per-sentence embedding needed at chunk-build time,
unlike `semantic_chunker.py`).

State this explicitly as a limitation/future-work item in your
dissertation (RQ5 / Chapter 5) rather than letting the file's presence
in the repo go unexplained.

| Chunking | `src/chunking/structural_chunker.py` | Heading-aware section splitting — built but not used in the three-way comparison |
| Chunking | `src/chunking/semantic_chunker.py` | Sentence-embedding similarity breakpoints — the best-performing config |
| Embedding | `src/embeddings/embedder.py` | Sentence-transformers wrapper (default: all-MiniLM-L6-v2) |

## Retrieval design: multi-query, not single generic query

An earlier design used one generic query ("identify all privacy
practices..."). Debugging showed this consistently under-retrieved —
for a policy with a Bluetooth permission clause, the retriever never
surfaced it regardless of `top_k`, because the generic query sits
semantically far from specific device-permission phrasing.

The retriever now runs 6 targeted category queries (contact, location,
device identifiers, demographics, third-party sharing, SSO/login),
merges results by chunk_id, and keeps the highest similarity score seen
per chunk. `top_k` in the retriever config is per-query, not overall.

This did not fully solve the problem — further debugging showed that
even when the relevant evidence chunk was retrieved and passed to the
LLM, the model sometimes still failed to extract from it (see
`docs/limitations.md`, point 1). The retrieval fix increased evidence
coverage; it did not guarantee the LLM would use all of it.

## Why one comprehensive prompt instead of eight per-category questions

Querying once per privacy-practice category multiplies LLM calls by ~8x
for no retrieval benefit, since the same evidence chunks are usually
relevant to several categories at once. The single structured-JSON
extraction prompt (`src/generation/prompts.py`) asks the model to
return every supported practice in one pass, using a fixed vocabulary
of APP-350-style labels stated explicitly in the system prompt (this
vocabulary was necessary — without it, the model invented its own label
names that never matched ground truth).

## Retrieval/generation parameters used in the full 349-policy runs

All three configs used identical retrieval settings to isolate chunking
strategy as the controlled variable:
- `top_k: 8` (per category query)
- `similarity_threshold: 0.1`
- LLM timeout: 420s
- LLM temperature: 0.0
- Model: qwen2.5:7b via Ollama

These values were chosen via 20–30 policy pilot runs before the full
run, and separately validated by a threshold sweep
(`experiments/threshold_sweep/`) on a 15-policy subsample per config,
which showed thresholds 0.0–0.2 produced near-identical results (the
filter wasn't removing meaningful content at those levels).

## Known environment issue: chromadb version upgrade

`chromadb` was upgraded from 0.4.24 to 0.5.5 partway through the
project. This broke the previously stored vector database (collection
metadata format changed) and required two fixes:
1. Deleting and rebuilding `data/processed/chroma/` from scratch.
2. A code fix in `chroma_store.py`'s `query_policy()` — 0.5.5 rejects
   numpy arrays in `query_embeddings`, requiring an explicit
   `.tolist()` conversion.

`requirements.txt` pins `chromadb==0.5.5`; any future re-run should use
this exact version to avoid the same issue recurring.

## Results summary (full 349-policy runs)

| Config | Precision | Recall | F1 | Pipeline errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fixed_300 | 0.440 | 0.102 | 0.166 | 8 (5 JSON, 3 timeout) |
| fixed_500 | 0.457 | 0.100 | 0.164 | 7 (4 JSON, 3 timeout) |
| semantic | 0.496 | 0.258 | 0.339 | 13 (4 JSON, 9 timeout) |
